In this porject we will explore the fundumentals of neural networks with the use of the Mnist dataset. 
At first we will build a fully connected neural network from scratch using numpy. 
we will go through all the stages, from processing the data, initialize networks parameters, building the forwardpropagation, activation functions, loss function, backpropagation, updating parameters and predictions. We will also define a Adam optimizer and we will train the network with mini batches. 
                     *** All is done by scratch!***
                 
Then we will try different hyperparameters to understand thier effect on the network's performance. 

In the next step we will try working with the keras sequential, and we will implement the scratch network from before. 
In the final step we will build a CNN using keras package and will discuss the results.
